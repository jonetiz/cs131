2. The command used was `cat 'Global YouTube Statistics.csv' | cut -d, -f20-21 | sort | uniq -c | sort`, which displays the contents of Global YouTube Statistics.csv, removes all data except columns 20 and 21 (created date and month), sorts them, counts unique occurences, then sorts again so it's easy to find maximums.

3. 12 2014,Aug
2. 13 2014,Jul

3. I used 'ps -u jon'

PID TTY          TIME CMD
    381 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
    440 ?        00:00:00 systemd
    441 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)

4. I used 'ps -u jon'

PID TTY          TIME CMD
    381 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
    440 ?        00:00:00 systemd
    441 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
    446 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
   5107 pts/0    00:00:00 vi
   5230 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
   5280 pts/2    00:00:00 ps

The PID was 5107. After quitting vi, it was no longer in the process list because the program was no longer running.

5. The init process in linux (PID 1) is what gets Linux to run. To find it, I used 'ps aux' and it was at the top, owned by root.

6. ps aux displays ALL running process on the linux machine. It will show the owner, PID, current resource (CPU/Memory) usage, runtime, process location, and some other details.
