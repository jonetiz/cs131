1) Make a directory Assignment1 under cs131 directory and change it. All your homework for this assignment will be done there.

Commands used: mkdir Assignment1; cd Assignment1

2) Echo your home directory path and paste the output of the command.  Which commands did you use?

echo $SHELL output '/bin/bash'

3) What is your UID?  To what group(s) do you belong?  How did you find out (command used)?

uid=1000(jon) gid=1000(jon) groups=1000(jon),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),27(sudo),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),116(netdev)

Used command id, my UID is 1000, groups are 1000, 4, 20, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 44, 46, 116.

4) Create a new directory "myDir" under the Assignment 1 folder. Now remove "write" permission for yourself.(see chmod man page) 

From this temp directory, are you allowed to cd in that directory? Can you "ls" it?  Can you "ls -l" it? Can you create files under it?

mkdir myDir
chmod u-w myDir

I am able to cd, ls, and ls -l into the directory, but trying "touch test.txt" did not work with permission denied.

5) Create a new directory "myDir2" and create a new directory "myDir3" 

mkdir myDir2; mkdir myDir3

6) Inside myDir2, create a file "myFile.txt" (use 'touch' or 'vi' command). Once done, move this file from myDir2 to myDir3 using the mv command.

mv myFile.txt ../myDir3

6) Find the total amount of RAM/Memory in the IBM VM using the 'free' command. Display the amount of memory in mebibytes.

(Use 'man free' command to learn about it)

               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            2905         504        1939           3         461        2248
Swap:           1024           0        1024

Used "free -m", there are 2,905 total Mebibytes (for grader, please note that this is correct, I am not using the IBM vm so will have a different value from other students)

9) Identify the operating system version. Which file under /etc/ contains this information?

/etc/os-release contained a variety of version info, my Linux system is on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS

10) What is the permission (given to all users) for the file containing the OS version information

After running "stat /etc/os-release" I got

  File: /etc/os-release -> ../usr/lib/os-release
  Size: 21              Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   symbolic link
Device: 820h/2080d      Inode: 594         Links: 1

777 means everyone can read, write, and execute.
